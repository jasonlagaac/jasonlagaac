I've always worked on iOS for the most part of my mobile
development career and to speed up my development time on
projects, I have always used a third party library or
some shortcut to handle all my animation work. But if push
came to shove, I would make things on my own. Now I think
it's time for me to refresh and hone my skills relating to
animation work.

For the most part of this series, I'll be referring to the
book [iOS Animations by Tutorials](https://www.raywenderlich.com/store/ios-animations-by-tutorials) written by Marin Todorov. I'll take some of their examples and add some other spin to it.

I'll also be writing about some of my observations and general things about my refreshing/relearning process.

Here's to hoping I make it through the 30 days ðŸ˜¬
